Introduction
============

libweb is a framework for interacting with web sites of all shapes and sizes.
Parsers are included for the most common web formats, and new parsers are easy
to add. libweb officially supports Python 2.7, Python 3.3, Python 3.4 and
Python 3.5, making it easy to integrate into whatever your next web project may
be.

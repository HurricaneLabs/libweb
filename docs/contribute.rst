Code style rules
----------------

Code style for the libweb project follows 3 simple rules:

1. Our code should be readable and easy to follow.
2. Our code should be well commented.
3. Our code should be well tested.

Tox tests include coverage testing and certain code quality tests, and it is
expected that any PR's will maintain the same level of coverage and quality. No
preference is given for line length, single vs double quotes, etc, as long as
the code remains readable and understandable.
